Ah, the OG RSA challenge. 

```bash
e = 3
n = 135112325288715136727832177735512070625083219670480717841817583343851445454356579794543601926517886432778754079508684454122465776544049537510760149616899986522216930847357907483054348419798542025184280105958211364798924985051999921354369017984140216806642244876998054533895072842602131552047667500910960834243

This is a straight forward challenge, of course you can take these values and paste it in any RSA decoders like `dcode` or `RsaCtfTool` and it would work. But letâ€™s study the theory behind the reason that weâ€™re able to crack the cipher.

Hereâ€™s an example with the `RsaCtfTool`.

```bash
â””â”€$ python3 RsaCtfTool.py -n 135112325288715136727832177735512070625083219670480717841817583343851445454356579794543601926517886432778754079508684454122465776544049537510760149616899986522216930847357907483054348419798542025184280105958211364798924985051999921354369017984140216806642244876998054533895072842602131552047667500910960834243

Note: I deep dive into theoretical mathematics and cryptography. If you good, skip to the next challenge.

Okay, this challenge involves the vulnerability in the exponent being a small number. We call this the *small public exponent attack*.

In RSA encryption, the security comes from the difficulty of reversing the encryption process without the private key. The process is based on modular arithmetic, where a message m is raised to the power of an exponent e and then reduced modulo n. The encryption formula is:

$$
c=m^emodn
$$

Here, c is the ciphertext, e is the public exponent, and n is the modulus, which is a product of two large prime numbers.

When e is small, like e = 3 , and the message m is also small, something unusual can happen.

This is because, In typical RSA encryption, m^e should be much larger than n, so that the operation m^emodn effectively "`wraps around`" [Iâ€™ll come back on what wraps around really means] and gives a number within the range of 0 to n -1. This wrapping ensures that the original message $m$ cannot be easily derived from the ciphertext c.

However, if the message m is small, then m^e might still be smaller than . For example, if m is small and e =3, then:

$$
m^3 < n
$$

In this case, the operation m^3 modn does nothing because m^e is already smaller than n. Therefore, the ciphertext c will just be m^e without any reduction. So, we can write:

$$
c = m^3
$$

So if an attacker intercepts this ciphertext c , they can easily recover the original message m by taking the cube root of c :

$$
m = \sqrt[3]{c}
$$

This works because the ciphertext is just m^e, and taking the cube root of m^e gives back m. No special mathematical tricks or complex calculations are neededâ€”just a simple cube root operation.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The term "wraps around" refers to how modular arithmetic works. When we compute m^emodn, we are essentially reducing the number m^e to fit within the range from 0 to n -1.

</aside>

But funnily, there is a unique case for this, even thought what happens when m^e equals to n, Iâ€™ll leave this as an exercise for the reader to think about LOL.

`Exploit Time`

```python
import gmpy2

e = 3
n = 135112325288715136727832177735512070625083219670480717841817583343851445454356579794543601926517886432778754079508684454122465776544049537510760149616899986522216930847357907483054348419798542025184280105958211364798924985051999921354369017984140216806642244876998054533895072842602131552047667500910960834243

m = gmpy2.iroot(c, e)[0]
mInt = int(m)

mBytes = mInt.to_bytes((mInt.bit_length() + 7) // 8, byteorder='big')
flag = mBytes.decode('utf-8')

print("Flag:", flag)
```

Output:

```python
â””â”€$ python3 solve.py
Flag: n00bz{crypt0_1s_1nc0mpl3t3_w1th0ut_rs4!!}
```

Flag: `n00bz{crypt0_1s_1nc0mpl3t3_w1th0ut_rs4!!}`
