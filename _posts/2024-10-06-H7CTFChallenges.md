## Forensics

As usual, we take the Forensics route at the start.

Now, I’m looking at a collective challenge to make, it started off with Byte-Array PNG, moved on to Binary Images and now into Vector Graphics LOL. I’m looking at this things to actually learn on the process of creating them. Now into `ZLibs`. P.S. well, all that didn’t go so well, aspiring to create good challenges next time.

### **Khabib**

"I don't fight for the money. I fight for my legacy. I fight for history. I fight for my people." - Khabib Nurmagomedov

True to his words, the Eagle was one to watch out for, especially if you know where to look.

Author: **`Abu`**

Well, this challenge had the most solves in the CTF. So, when you `exiftool` the image, you would notice the dimensions for the image is huge. `20000 x 20000`

```bash

### Captain Cool

"It is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all doubt." - Mark Twain

All that is good, but Thala spoke the golden words `d-e-f-i-n-i-t-e-l-y-n-o-t` .

Author: **`Abu`**

Given: `white.png`

Since the given image is a PNG [Portable Network Graphics] image, that itself reduces the scope of search by quite a margin. After going about trying OG tools like `zsteg` and others, you notice there is a string that Thala spoke the golden words, `d-e-f-i-n-i-t-e-l-y-n-o-t` . This definitely looks like a password,  now looking at some tools that can input PNGs and a password, we stumble upon `OpenStego`.

![2](../assets/posts/H7CTFChalls/2.png)

Open Stego with the password `d-e-f-i-n-i-t-e-l-y-n-o-t`, without the hyphens obviously, would give you a binary file.

Convert it to hex and then to ASCII, which gives you the flag.

flag: `H7CTF{7h1s_h4s_t0_b3_0n3_of_7h3_L4rg3s7_b1n4ry_im4g3s}`

### Blimey

"I don't pretend to be captain weird. I just do what I do." - Johnny Depp

Author: **`Abu`**

Given: `stego`

We’re given an executable in a Forensics challenge, pretty strange. 

```bash
└─$ file stego
stego: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, Go BuildID=B9OUo6iP1s_hegoQnXM_/AoCYZrqNvR-EFLPnGGC1/0eqiKqmNKqAlwdnrTr2q/k8a5abbJQUx7DB3DynPL, with debug_info, not stripped
```

Other normal stuff, like strings, binwalk and when you run it. It seems it’s a `jsteg` tool. Well, that is another rabbit hole. `ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64`. It’s a x86 file, so looking at tools related to x86 forensics.

Let’s move on to this, interesting tool which hides messages in x86 programs using semantic duals.

[Steg86](https://github.com/woodruffw/steg86)

```bash
cargo install steg86
```

`Cargo` is Rust's package manager.

```bash
steg86 embed random stego <<< "H7CTF{eXecu74bl3s_1n_s73g0_1s_qU1te_uh34rd_0ff}"
```

Now, the executable is ready for production.

```bash
└─$ steg86 extract stego
H7CTF{eXecu74bl3s_1n_s73g0_1s_qU1te_uh34rd_0ff}
```

Flag: `H7CTF{eXecu74bl3s_1n_s73g0_1s_qU1te_uh34rd_0ff}`

### **Evolve**

“Civilization is the subordination of the individual to the welfare of the community.” - Charles Fourier

Author: **`Abu`**

Given: `flag.png`

Given in the description is name of the person involves in this technique. Maybe I was wrong to select quotes as descriptions as I thought it would be better than some long-random-GPT generated messages. Will keep it in mind while doing it next time.

Well, this is another steganographic technique. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a mathematical technique that transforms data between time (or spatial) domain and frequency domain. In the context of steganography, hiding data in the frequency domain involves manipulating the frequency components of an image or audio signal rather than directly altering pixel or sample values.

You can of course, write a script to solve this, but also a tool mentioned above.

### Empty

"When one's expectations are reduced to zero, one really appreciates everything one does have." - Stephen Hawking

Author: **`Abu`**

Given: `zero.zip`

We see that the zip is encrypted, so we run `john` and `rockyou` against it.

```bash
└─$ zip2john zero.zip > hash
ver 1.0 zero.zip/zero/ is not encrypted, or stored with non-handled compression type
ver 1.0 zero.zip/zero/‎/ is not encrypted, or stored with non-handled compression type
ver 1.0 zero.zip/zero/‎/.git/ is not encrypted, or stored with non-handled compression type
ver 1.0 zero.zip/zero/‎/.git/branches/ is not encrypted, or stored with non-handled compression type
ver 2.0 efh 5455 efh 7875 zero.zip/zero/‎/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG PKZIP Encr: TS_chk, cmplen=145, decmplen=188, crc=6274FC0F ts=9DAD cs=9dad type=8
<>
ver 2.0 efh 5455 efh 7875 zero.zip/zero/‎/.secret PKZIP Encr: TS_chk, cmplen=43, decmplen=101, crc=6191A448 ts=5906 cs=5906 type=8
NOTE: It is assumed that all files in each archive have the same password.
If that is not the case, the hash may be uncrackable. To avoid this, use
option -o to pick a file at a time.
```

Using `zip2john` to convert the encrypted zip hash into a format that john understands.

```bash
└─$ john --wordlist=rockyou.txt hash
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (PKZIP [32/64])
Will run 4 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed.
```

Now, we get the password for the zip file = `canyoutellmesomeinformationaboutyourself` 

```bash
└─$ unzip zero.zip
Archive:  zero.zip
[zero.zip] zero/‎/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG password:
replace zero/‎/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG? [y]es, [n]o, [A]ll, [N]one, [r]ename: A

  inflating: zero/‎/.git/description

 <>
 extracting: zero/‎/.git/refs/heads/master
  inflating: zero/‎/.secret
```

Using the password to unzip the zip file, we find that it’s a git repository.

Going into the directories, we see an directory with a `unicode` character. Going deeper, we see a `.secret` file.

```bash
└─$ ls -la
total 0
drwxrwxrwx 1 abu abu 512 Oct  6 18:47 .
drwxrwxrwx 1 abu abu 512 Sep 19 11:24 ..
drwxrwxrwx 1 abu abu 512 Oct  6 18:42 .git
-rwxrwxrwx 1 abu abu 101 Sep 19 11:08 .secret
```

![5](../assets/posts/H7CTFChalls/5.png)

We can make out that there is `white-space stego` involved here. Opening it in VS Code, could give a better view.

Using `stegsnow` against the `.secret` file.

```bash
└─$ stegsnow -C .secret
somethingrandom
```

Results in something meaningless. So moving on. On to the interesting `.git` directory.

```bash
└─$ git log

It seems all messed up, you have to question this. Doing so, will lead you to discovering a concept called `Zero-Width Steganography` and that is pretty cool.

[Unicode Steganography with Zero-Width Characters](https://330k.github.io/misc_tools/unicode_steganography.html)

Using it to decode the text, we get the flag. 

![7](../assets/posts/H7CTFChalls/7.png)

Flag: `H7CTF{z3r0_w1d7h_steg0_r0ck$}`

<aside>
💡

There was actually an unintended flag in the git repository, using a `gitdumper` on it, revealed a gimp.xcf file, which contained a flag for an unreleased challenge. It never struck my mind to check the files in the .git repo. 

</aside>

Here’s a little refresher on how to extract files from a local directory. Of course there should be tools for this, but there is this way as well.

To extract the files from the latest commit (i.e., the `HEAD` of the current branch), you can simply use:

```bash
└─$ git checkout .
Updated 1 path from the index
```

```bash
└─$ for commit in $(git rev-list --all); do
    echo "Extracting files from commit $commit"
    git checkout $commit -- .
done

```

Now, you can see all the files that were in and out of the directory.

```bash
└─$ ls
fdct.go  gimp.xcf  photo.png  scan.go  some.aac
```

### Base X

Description: "To solve complex problems, start with a simple base and build from there." — Unknown

Author: `Abu`

Given: `wTWY+%u_M_\1c`,\_D8A{1<[_i_aa/0|S)q)D247Dc$|@SQ1}_qawe8twW`

Long story short, the ideology behind this challenge is to help the participants help understand how bases work in detail. Starting off from Base64, which is the most common, if you look at the characters in the Base cipher, you see a lot of characters that are outside the Base64 range, so we move on. If you inspect the characters in detail, you would notice this character `}` , which is numbered 125 in the ASCII table, and that would point towards the printable ASCII characters, which are a total of 95 characters, and trying to decode this base cipher with the `Base94` encryption will reveal the flag.

<aside>
💡

The notes below are a rough idea of when I was creating the challenge, a lot of this and that, but I’ll leave this here, just in-case someone finds it helpful.

</aside>

Here’s explanation on how bases work in general, the bases correspond to the numbers of characters in the character set, let’s say base 2, which is binary, has only 2 characters to represent. Whereas in the case of base64, the character set is 64,  [ `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/` ] and so on with base94, which uses 94 characters, I choose this unique and rare base encryption because the participants can know more about bases and how those work at least to some extent and also when you observe the individual characters in a given cipher, and you notice a character is that being used outside of the current count of base operation that the user is attempting only then will they be able to move on to finding the exact base encryption in hand. I also think the description does provide a route that the solver can profit from starting off from the most common and moving on to bases with larger character sets.

Moving on the next stage of encryption, the flag which is typically in alphanumeric format, is converted to binary for ease of operations, and then grouped together in chunks depending on the base. In base64, the binary data is grouped into 6-bit chunks as to represent 64 unique characters, you would need $2^6 = 64$, or at least 6 bit to represent these. In the case of base94, which has 94 unique characters, you would need $2^7 = 128$, which would easily cover the 94 character list.
We first ensure that the binary string length is a multiple of 7 by adding padding bits (`0`s). In our case, this is the `010010000011011101000011010101000100011001111011011000100011010001110011011001010101001101011111011000110011010001101110010111110110001000110011010111110110110100110000011001000011000101100110001100010011001101100100010111110110001000110011011110010011000001101110011001000101111101110010001100110110001100110000011001110110111000110001011101000011000100110000011011100111110100`, binary data which is 378 character long, with the last 2 0’s padded to make the entire data a multiple of 7. Then we divided it to 54 chunks of data. Then take each chunk and convert it to decimal before assign the encoded decimal to it’s equivalent in the character list. 

<aside>
💡

The tool mentioned seems to do the job but there are variances in each of them. I should prepare a script that follows these generic steps to avoid any nuances.

</aside>

Another point to note is that the user has be aware that, even though the entire data is divided into 7-bit chunks but the binary is getting read as a traditional 8-bit binary will lead to an incorrect solution. Finally, make sure to map the numbers to the exact characters corresponding to base94 characters, are the printable characters start from 33 onwards, you might need to substract 33 from the decimal as it exceed the character value of 0-93. Oh wait,  I think I messed up my ideology. I guess we need to `start over again.` With no time, sadly, we have to shift to the tool to implement this, but updating the title to `Base X`. L in the chat for my scripting skills, really need to put some work on them.

Now, when we use a tool to decipher the Base94, we reveal the flag.

[Base94-RS](https://github.com/Antosser/base94-rs)

```bash
cargo install base94

base94cli encode flag.txt base

```

Flag: `H7CTF{b4seS_c4n_b3_m0d1f13d_b3y0nd_r3c0gn1t10n}`

Here’s a typical RSA encryption with a twist, the last 4 digits of the ciphertext is redacted, the idea is to prevent the usage of tools like `dCode` or some RSA cracking software. Now, we write a script to solve this problem, essentially bruteforcing the last 4 digits in the cipher to reveal the plaintext.

Yo, there is actually quite an amusing story behind this `GPP[Group Policy Preferences]`, 

<aside>
💡

Imagine you’re the boss of a big company, and you have a bunch of computers that need to do specific things.

Now, instead of running around to each computer and setting everything up one by one (which would take forever!), you have a magic tool called “Group Policy Preferences” or GPP.

GPP is like your super assistant that helps you tell all the computers what to do, like where to put files, which programs to use, and what settings to follow. It’s like giving a secret code to all your computers so they know how to work together like a well-oiled team

Initial idea, create a folder structure similar to the original one found in SYSVOL, including all necessary directories before and after it. Inside this folder, place the `Groups.xml` file, which contains a `cpassword` field that the user needs to decrypt using the known key provided by Microsoft. Once the folder structure is ready, compress the entire directory into a zip file and secure it with a password derived from one of the last entries in `rockyou.txt`.
This way, I believe more people will get to know about the GPP vulnerability and a basic zip brute-forcing exercise.

```

Since this is the 32-byte key that was **inadvertently** leaked by Microsoft, the cipher is a AES-256 one and since we use ECB for this, we don’t have to worry about the IV.

### Strike

`Description`: 

The author embarked on their CS50 journey last fall, and for their first project, they ventured onto a public programming site. The key to uncovering the hidden flag lies in the username they used in the past.

P.S. There are a ton of ways to solve this challenge so keep digging.

Author: **Abu**

First of all making this particular repository private as it take it right to the reward LOL. But there are other projects that are lying around, I guess even LinkedIn should be having the project list.

<img src="/assets/posts/H7CTFChalls/11.png" alt="p4" width="70%"/>

Also, this LinkedIn project also takes the user straight into it.

![12](../assets/posts/H7CTFChalls/12.png)

Here is the a probable approach that the users could take. Finding the previous username from a part commit in the profile repository. 

![13](../assets/posts/H7CTFChalls/13.png)

In the comments of the Profile Repo, there is another hint for the challenge.

In the first commit of the Profile Repository there is a comment. But like I said, there are so many ways to solve this. LinkedIn, Lichess, people basically dug up my whole life for this challenge LOL. Scary AF.

### **QRco**

A seemingly innocuous QR code holds the key to a puzzle concealed in plain sight. Your quest begins with the scan of a code that unveils a document shrouded in mystery.

Author: **`SHL`**

Given: `QRco.jpg`
In this challenge, you are presented with a **QR code** that leads to a Google Drive link containing a **PDF** with a list of numbered entries, each associated with random strings of letters and symbols. Additionally, **ArUco markers** are embedded within the QR code image, making them visually apparent. You must extract these ArUco markers, find their IDs, and then use the PDF to map the corresponding letters. These letters, when assembled, form a **Base64 string**, which, when decoded, reveals the flag.

**Walkthrough**:

**Step 1: Scanning the QR Code**:

- When participants scan the QR code, they are directed to a **Google Drive link** that contains a PDF file.
- This PDF file lists numbers from **1 to 1000**, each associated with random strings of characters.
- This is a key part of the challenge as the ArUco marker IDs found later will correspond to these numbered entries in the PDF.

**Step 2: Identifying the ArUco Markers**:

- You will quickly notice that **ArUco markers** are embedded within the QR code image itself. These markers are visibly placed and relatively easy to detect.
- To extract the ArUco marker IDs, you can use **OpenCV** and Python. Here is a sample script for detecting the ArUco markers:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import time

# Define ArUco dictionary types
ARUCO_DICT = {
    "DICT_4X4_50": cv2.aruco.DICT_4X4_50,
    "DICT_4X4_100": cv2.aruco.DICT_4X4_100,
    "DICT_4X4_250": cv2.aruco.DICT_4X4_250,
    "DICT_4X4_1000": cv2.aruco.DICT_4X4_1000,
    "DICT_5X5_50": cv2.aruco.DICT_5X5_50,
    "DICT_5X5_100": cv2.aruco.DICT_5X5_100,
    "DICT_5X5_250": cv2.aruco.DICT_5X5_250,
    "DICT_5X5_1000": cv2.aruco.DICT_5X5_1000,
    "DICT_6X6_50": cv2.aruco.DICT_6X6_50,
    "DICT_6X6_100": cv2.aruco.DICT_6X6_100,
    "DICT_6X6_250": cv2.aruco.DICT_6X6_250,
    "DICT_6X6_1000": cv2.aruco.DICT_6X6_1000,
    "DICT_7X7_50": cv2.aruco.DICT_7X7_50,
    "DICT_7X7_100": cv2.aruco.DICT_7X7_100,
    "DICT_7X7_250": cv2.aruco.DICT_7X7_250,
    "DICT_7X7_1000": cv2.aruco.DICT_7X7_1000,
    "DICT_ARUCO_ORIGINAL": cv2.aruco.DICT_ARUCO_ORIGINAL,
    "DICT_APRILTAG_16h5": cv2.aruco.DICT_APRILTAG_16h5,
    "DICT_APRILTAG_25h9": cv2.aruco.DICT_APRILTAG_25h9,
    "DICT_APRILTAG_36h10": cv2.aruco.DICT_APRILTAG_36h10,
    "DICT_APRILTAG_36h11": cv2.aruco.DICT_APRILTAG_36h11
}

# Choose ArUco dictionary type
aruco_type = ARUCO_DICT["DICT_5X5_1000"]

# Load the dictionary and parameters
arucoDict = cv2.aruco.getPredefinedDictionary(aruco_type)
parameters = cv2.aruco.DetectorParameters()

image_path = "QRco.jpg"  # Replace this with the path to your input image
image = cv2.imread(image_path)

if image is None:
    print("Error: Image not loaded correctly.")
    exit()

# Detect ArUco markers in the image
corners, ids, rejected = cv2.aruco.detectMarkers(image, arucoDict, parameters=parameters)

# Copy the original image for visualization
imageCopy = image.copy()

# Draw detected markers
if ids is not None:
    cv2.aruco.drawDetectedMarkers(imageCopy, corners, ids)

# Optionally, draw rejected markers
showRejected = True
if showRejected and rejected is not None and len(rejected) > 0:
    cv2.aruco.drawDetectedMarkers(imageCopy, rejected, borderColor=(100, 0, 255))

output_image_path = "output_with_markers.jpg"
cv2.imwrite(output_image_path, imageCopy)

cv2.imshow("Detected ArUco Markers", imageCopy)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

print(f"Processed image saved as: {output_image_path}")

```

After running the code you get the following output

<img src="/assets/posts/H7CTFChalls/18.jpg" alt="p4" width="60%"/>

Now, by reading the numbers column by column from left to right and then refer it to the pdf you get the following:

```python
    548: 'SDdD',
    729: 'VEZ7',
    176: 'UVJ4',
    839: 'NHJV',
    612: 'YzBf',
    493: 'RW4x',
    984: 'Z200',
    251: 'fQ=='
```

Which when combined together gives you 

```python
SDdDVEZ7UVJ4NHJVYzBfRW4xZ200fQ==
```

which is a base64 string. Finally you decode this to get the flag.
